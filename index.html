								<font style="text-decoration: underline">SCRIPT for contacting CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS</font></br>
								Here’s a choice of phone call or email scripts to Oppose SB 50. (You may be asked for your zip code because senators want to hear from people in their districts).
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li style="padding-bottom:20px;font-style:italic;line-height:1.5">
									“My name is ___. I live in your district. I’m calling about SB 50. As my representative, I urge you to oppose this bill. SB 50 will bring severe displacement and 
									gentrification and HURT the poor and working-class, and wipe out thousands of middle-class single-family-home neighborhoods. In our district, developers could decimate 
									areas like (fill in your area). SB 50 strips city zoning and planning powers in <font style="text-decoration: underline"> neighborhoods near bus or rail stops</font>, 
									letting developers go as high as 8 stories. The heart of this bill is demolition of housing. Our community will never recover.”
								</li>
								<li style="padding-bottom:20px;font-style:italic;line-height:1.5">
									“My name is ___. I live in your district. I’m calling about SB 50. As my representative, I urge you to oppose this bill. If SB 50 isn’t killed, my city (name) 
									<font style="text-decoration: underline">can only reject 6-to 8 story luxury towers in transit zones or “job rich” zones if the project “harms public safety." 
									Developers get to leave out parking entirely and wipe out green belts, side yards and setbacks where children play.</font> This means destruction of single-family 
									AND rental housing to make way for luxury one-bedrooms, forcing families further from jobs. Imagine the nightmare, and oppose SB 50.”
								</li>
								<li style="font-style:italic;line-height:1.5">
									“My name is ___. I live in your district. I’m calling about SB 50. As my representative, I urge you to oppose this bill. One-size-fits-all thinking doesn’t work. 
									SB 50 is a real estate bill, not a housing solution. Senator Wiener’s YIMBY base calls single family homes ‘racist’ and ‘immoral.’ Rather than solving the housing problem, 
									SB 50 promotes demotion, displacement, gentrification, and deepening income inequity.”

				Written by legislator Scott Wiener, SB 50 rewards developers to buy and demolish single-family housing and apartments near rail, train, ferry or busy bus stops AND near jobs and 
				good schools. SB 50 kills local planning rules, letting buildings tower over homes. The towers can include NO parking, NO space for trees, NO setbacks, and NO design standards. 
				All that developers must do is include a few "affordable" rental units.

						What ELSE does SB 50 dramatically change in our communities?
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0">
						Developers can override up to 6 planning standards, according to an in-depth analysis by the San Francisco Department of Planning. Developers become their own 
						zoners and planners. Cities would be barred from fighting bad development <b>unless an SB 50 project is so bad that it's a direct public safety threat</b> (not an 
						indirect threat like smog).
						</br></br>
						Here's just a sample of rules developers can abandon under SB 50. Cities, counties and communities would have no say.
						<ol>
							<li>No parking required in apartment towers </li>
							<li>Override density maximums (number of apartment units per parcel) </li>
							<li>Slash or eliminate yards, and building setbacks for trees</li>
							<li>Allow demolition of historic buildings not protected by the state</li>
							<li>Eliminate on-site open space (balconies, courtyards)</li>
							<li>Remove demolition controls</li>
							<li>Ignore design standards</li>
							<li>Evade Impact Fees </li>

						What is a jobs-rich/good schools area? And why will SB 50 let developers overrun these areas with tall apartments, even if the area doesn't have transit?
					</p>
					<p>
						The definition of "jobs-rich" areas was published in March of 2019 by the Haas Institute. The huge gold-colored "jobs rich" areas shown on this map sweep across California. 
						They target 1000s of single-family neighborhoods, apartment areas and streets that allow mixed-use (businesses with housing on top). Sen. Scott Wiener has been quoted by 
						some as saying single-family homes are "immoral," yards take up too much room, and these areas must be stamped out to build apartments. 
					</p>
					
					<p class="faq-header">
						Why does SB 50 say "minimum heights" would be 45 or 55 feet? It doesn't mention 75 or 85 feet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Under state "Density Bonus" law, a developer can already add up to 3 floors (30 feet) to the height of a building. This is a financial reward given if a developer adds 
						a few affordable units. But under SB 50, a developer can add up to 3 floors atop a new "minimum height" of 45 or 55 feet. Vast areas would be forced to accept 7-story 
						and 8-story towers. Sen. Wiener has gone to great pains to avoid explaining this in SB 50.

					<p class="faq-header">
						How does SB 50 displace 1000s of renters?
					</p>
					<p>
						SB 50 promises protections that can't be enforced. Its “ban” on the demolition of occupied apartments instead prompts developers to buy out renters and claim it was 
						vacant — a top social justice problem in California.
					</p>
						
					<p class="faq-header">
						How does SB 50 gentrify hundreds of diverse and sensitive communities?
					</p>
					<p>
						SB 50 forces diverse neighborhoods to agree to gentrification and luxury towers by 2025, annihilating their thriving communities.
					</p>

				<div class="column" style="width:45%;">	
					<p class="faq-header">
						What is a High-Frequency Bus Stop? If my city adds more buses, would that allow developers to overrun my area with tall apartments?
					</p>
					<p>
						Yes. "High-frequency" means buses that stop every 15 minutes in morning/evening, and every 30 minutes on weekends. Transit agencies can add buses to reach that "frequency",
						and this, in turn, would hand developers blanket new powers under SB 50 to overrun your area with tall apartments. SB 50 <font style="text-decoration:underline">will create 
						wars against bus service</font> statewide. San Diego has upgraded some bus lines to 15-minute service but its residents don't realize SB 50 developers will now overrun these 
						streets. All people wanted was bus service.
